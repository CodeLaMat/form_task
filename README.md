# Form Task:

## Short description

Welcome to my FormTask application. This application is created as a task assigned to me as a part of my studies in REACT22S programme.

FormTask is a web application where users can input their notes and messages and send it to the database kept in .json format in local machine. The Form Task is a simple app where I practiced passing data from parent to child, onClick and onChange events, triggering modal popup component.

## Technologies used

### Built with:

- REACT
- CSS
- JS
- HTML
- JSON

## Setup and usage

Live page [here](https://codelamat.github.io/form_task/). Note! You may face difficulties to see the database in livepage since the database is in local db file. It is recomended to clone the gitHub link and run the server locally.
